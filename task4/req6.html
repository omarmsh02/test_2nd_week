    <p>Text messaging, or simply texting, is the act of composing 
        <br>and sending electronic messages, typically consisting 
        <br>of alphabetic and numeric characters, between two or 
        <br>more users of mobile phones, tablet computers, 
        <br>smartwatches, desktops/laptops, or another type of 
        <br>compatible computer. Text messages may be sent over a 
        <br>cellular network or may also be sent via satellite or 
        <br>Internet connection.The term originally referred to 
        <br>messages sent using the Short Message Service (SMS) on 
        <br>mobile devices. It has grown beyond alphanumeric text to
        <br> include multimedia messages using the Multimedia 
        <br>Messaging Service (MMS) and Rich Communication Services 
        <br>(RCS), which can contain digital images, videos, and 
        <br>sound content, as well as ideograms known as emoji 
        <br>(happy faces, sad faces, and other icons), and on 
        <br>various instant messaging apps. Text messaging has been 
        <br>an extremely popular medium of communication since the 
        <br>turn of the century and has also influenced changes in 
        <br>society.[1][2][3][4]Overview Text messages are used for
        <br> personal, family, business, and social purposes. 
        <br>Governmental and non-governmental organizations use 
        <br>text messaging for communication between colleagues. 
        <br>In the 2010s, the sending of short informal messages 
        <br>became an accepted part of many cultures, as happened 
        <br>earlier with emailing.[5] This makes texting a quick 
        <br>and easy way to communicate with friends, family, and 
        <br>colleagues, including in contexts where a call would be 
        <br>impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very late at 
        <br>night or when one knows the other person is busy with 
        <br>family or work activities). Like e-mail and voicemail,
        <br> and unlike calls (in which the caller hopes to speak 
        <br>directly with the recipient), texting does not require
        <br> the caller and recipient to both be free at the same 
        <br>moment; this permits communication even between busy 
        <br>individuals. Text messages can also be used to interact 
        <br>with automated systems, for example, to order products 
        <br>or services from e-commerce websites or to participate 
        <br>in online contests. Advertisers and service providers 
        <br>use direct text marketing to send messages to mobile 
        <br>users about promotions, payment due dates, and other 
        <br>notifications instead of using postal mail, email, or voicemail.</p>
